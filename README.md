# Webdesign Final 2020-2021
Thesis for the webdesign course in the 6th grade IT management at Atheneum Boom.

This is my thesis for the second year of webdesign. This is (a large part of) a webshop with a responsive front-end, a back-end written in php, and a mysql database. 
This is by no means a "good" webshop when looking at UX, us not being allowed to use any pre-made utilities, me being terrible at CSS, and the fact that I may or may not have started the weekend before the due date..., although, I am pretty proud of a few bits and bobs in here.

To run this project, set up a traditional php 7 or higher LAMP stack.
