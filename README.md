# Webdesign Final 2020-2021
Thesis for the webdesign course in the 6th grade IT management at Atheneum Boom.

This is my thesis for the second year of webdesign. This is (a large part of) a webshop with a responsive front-end, a back-end written in php and a mysql database. 
This project was made under some constraints that made the end result less than optimal (Eg. language localization). 

## Run requirements
- Apache HTTP server
- PHP 7
- MySQL
