# Webdesign Final 2020-2021
Thesis for the webdesign course in the 6th grade IT management at Atheneum Boom.

This is my thesis for the second year of webdesign. This is (a large part of) a webshop with a responsive front-end, a back end written in php, and a mysql database. 
This is by no means a "good" webshop when looking at UI/UX, us not being allowed to use any libraries, no SEO, lacking Featureset, me being bad at CSS, Sloppy code I scrambled together a few days before the due date etc...
But it was good enough to prove I'm capable of making something that works.

To run this project, set up a php 7 or above webserver with a mysql (or mariadb) database. 
Import the files from mysql into the db and place the contents of root in your root folder. 
If required change db credentials. Current credentials: un=root pw=usbw
